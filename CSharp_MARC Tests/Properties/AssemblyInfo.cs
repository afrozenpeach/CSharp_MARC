 * Parser for MARC records

 * This project is based on the File_MARC package 
 * (http://pear.php.net/package/File_MARC) by Dan Scott , which was based on PHP
 * MARC package, originally called "php-marc", that is part of the Emilda 
 * Project (http://www.emilda.org). Both projects were released under the LGPL
 * which allowed me to port the project to C# for use with the .NET Framework.
